Aim of The Project

The aim of the Project is to determine whether the system percolates or not.

<p>
What is percolation?

Consider that water is above all the bricks.
Below all the bricks there is dry land.
When the water reaches the below dry land we say the system percolates.
In the beginning there is no way for the water to travel down(as there are bricks in the way)
A user can remove the bricks by clicking on them.
A removed brick is shown using green color(meaning there is space but no water) or a blue brick( meaning water has reached there)
